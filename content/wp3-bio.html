            <p>The H-cluster active center of [FeFe]-hydrogenase can be considered a strongly correlated electronic system in which the geometrical structure, spin densities, and electronic interactions play a significant role in its molecular function. Single crystal EPR has been successfully applied to [NiFe]-hydrogenases due to the availability of relative large crystals.  Electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments revealed the geometrical and electronic structure of the intermediates and their redox behaviour. All experiments provide information on weak magnetic interactions of the paramagnetic system with surrounding nuclear spins residing on ligands and protein side-chains. By improving EPR measurements and coupling the data to quantum-chemical calculations, the extraction of the full magnetic interaction tensors of the active site and the accessory [4Fe-4S] clusters provide understanding of [FeFe]-hydrogenases catalytic mechanism.</p>

            <p>With the development of nano-EPR we will be able to access, for the first time, protein microcrystals of sizes used for X-ray crystallography structure determination (nanoliter to sub-nanoliter volumes). The current project will be specifically focussed on the [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzymes studied at MPI-CEC, with its active site shown in Fig. 6, but the methods and technology are applicable to any protein crystal and, potentially, even to single biological cells. </p>

            <p> The [FeFe]-hydrogenases from the bacteria Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (DdHydAB) and Clostridium pasteurianum (Cp1) have been crystallized and can be expressed heterologously in E. coli making use of the artificial maturation technique co-developed at MPI-CEC and the universities of Grenoble and Bochum. This unique procedure provides full access to both the protein sequence as well as the structure of the cofactor. In addition, interesting experiments with cofactor and protein environments labelled with magnetic isotopes are possible. Therefore, apart from the wild-type protein, mutants and variants with modified active sites become available. By choosing the appropriate mutants and variants, the paramagnetic states in the active site can be influenced and several catalytic intermediates (such as the hydride state) can be stabilized and studied by single crystal EPR techniques. This is a long-term, career building, objective. In light of this, we limit the initial scope of the fellowship to apo and wild-type hydrogenase.</p>
