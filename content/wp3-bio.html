            <p>The H-cluster active center of [FeFe]-hydrogenase can be considered a strongly correlated electronic system in which the geometrical structure, spin densities, and electronic interactions play a significant role in its molecular function. Single crystal EPR has been successfully applied to [NiFe]-hydrogenases due to the availability of relative large crystals (0.5&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;x&nbsp;1.0&nbsp;mm<sup>3</sup>). However, protien crystals from [FeFe]-Hydrogenase are
            significantly smaller (approximately 50 times). With the development of nano-EPR we will be able to access, <b>for the first time</b>, protein microcrystals of sizes used for X-ray crystallography structure determination (nanoliter to sub-nanoliter volumes). The current project will be specifically focussed on the [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzymes, with its active site shown to the right, but the methods and technology are applicable to any protein crystal. </p>

            <p> The [FeFe]-hydrogenases from the bacteria Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (DdHydAB) and Clostridium pasteurianum (Cp1) have been crystallized and can be expressed heterologously in E. coli making use of the artificial maturation technique co-developed at MPI-CEC and the universities of Grenoble and Bochum. This unique procedure provides full access to both the protein sequence as well as the structure of the cofactor. In addition, interesting experiments with cofactor and protein environments labelled with magnetic isotopes are possible. Therefore, apart from the wild-type protein, mutants and variants with modified active sites become available. By choosing the appropriate mutants and variants, the paramagnetic states in the active site can be influenced and several catalytic intermediates (such as the hydride state) can be stabilized and studied by single crystal EPR techniques. This is a long-term, career building, objective. In light of this, we limit the initial scope of the fellowship to apo and wild-type hydrogenase.</p>
